The ipynb file combining dataset takes all of the datasets in the folders above and combines them into a single excel csv dataset as output in dataset_combined.
The cleaned up dataset is then read into the Neural_network_architecture ipynb and tested for ML algorithms.

The result of this work is recorded under the folder "Final Report"
